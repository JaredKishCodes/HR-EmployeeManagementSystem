👨‍💼 Employee Management System






A full-stack Employee Management System with role-based access control.
Includes features for managing employees, departments, leaves, attendance, and payroll, along with secure login and registration.

📖 Introduction & Background

Many organizations still rely on manual processes for handling employee records, leaves, payroll, and attendance. This leads to inefficiency, errors, and data security risks. An Employee Management System ensures smooth operations and accurate record-keeping.
